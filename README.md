## What is this?

* This is my personal website, where I will post my projects and other stuff.
* I'm using [Astro](https://astro.build/) as a static site generator, and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a CSS framework.
* I will probably remove tailwind and use [Astro's built-in CSS support](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/styling) in the future. (Tailwind make the code messy, I need to find a way to better organize without affect performance)

## How to run

* Clone this repo
* Run `pnpm i` to install dependencies
* Run `pnpm dev` to start the dev server
* Run `pnpm check` to check for any astro or TS issue
* Run `pnpm index` to generate the search index
* Run `pnpm build` to build the site
